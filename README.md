# translatingAllWinPy3
translation app for windows, with UI
## It's all the same with translateAll :)

However, for Windows users, it doesn't mean that you can just download this and go on executing. If you are a developer, you might just naturally know how it should be working. If you are not a developer, then I am afraid that you won't be patient enough to setup this whole thing.

Anyway, developer or not, just tell me if something bothers you. Email: 502092439@qq.com
